This folder is divided into folders: OneDimension, Flory2D and Renyi2D.
In each folder is the code used to run simulations, the data produced (in .txt),
the code used to process the data, and the graphs produced.

In 'OneDimension', 'Renyi' and 'SimpleFlory' do the bulk of the processing, and are referenced in
chapters 2 and 4 respectively.

For Flory2D, 'ParkingTemplate.py', located outside the folder, assists Flory2dCircles and Flory2dSquares,
neither are referenced in the report, though they produce images for presentation and report.
The actual code referenced is in Flory2D.

For Renyi2D, the primary code referenced in the final chapter is written in the file of the same name.
